                    <h2>CHALLENGES FACING MODERN SOCIETY AND ITS SOLUTION</h2>
                    <div class="englishbox"><p>
                        This has been a tough question to answer since I do not know how much nature influences me and to what extent it influences me and knowing where I come from influences me? I found everything laid down for me such as the 8-4-4 system. The question is after the last 4 of the 8-4-4 system, where do I go next? A recall after 8 years of studies, I go to high school for another 4 years, then another 4 years I go to the university, immediately, I am told that I am an adult. The question is why do you plan my early life and in my old age, you want me to start figuring out life? Why are you teaching an old dog, new tricks?
                        Does where I come from, influence where I am going? Nature or nurture, I wish I knew that which is most important, because when life is tough, that is when we face our biggest challenges. It will be nice to know which part of our identities we draw strength from. Since my professor did not specify the method of discussion, I decided to involve discussions among my colleges, to understand their view towards the topic. Fake names will be used for their discretion.
                        <i><br><br> <b>Lucia:</b> 	My life is centered around the books and I am used to winning every activity, book contest, performance award. 
                        <br> <b>Me:</b> 	I asked about outside the school work, what does she do?
                        <br> <b>Lucia:</b> 	 I am trying to figure out who I am.
                        <br> <b>Brian:</b> 	I had lost in my favorite football game to Arsenal, so, I do not recognize myself again.
                        <br> <b>Me:</b> 	(Brian crying, placing a gentle pat on his shoulder) it is okay.
                        <br> <b>Chris:</b>	I am the best performer in his class and yet I felt that I lack something. My identity is tied to how much I work for my grades and my overall best performance. I come from a family of singers, but I got the scholarship of books to join this campus. Therefore, this makes me the first to go to university with the scholarship of good performance(merit). I have a deadly disease and I feels that what I have worked for is gone. This means that knowing your family tree and everything is a part of me, but it is not me, so, you still have to figure it out and find something new. (shows a face of worry )
                        <br> <b>Kisha:</b>	(excited) She feels that she belongs to nature and that she is a strong Black Kenyan woman and she is proud coming from two different culture households. There are parts that I do not know about the family, since after my parent’s marriage, the family members cut them off. However, in the absence of those parts of identity that I do not know, I cling to those that I know for example, I love dancing and dance comes from my mother’s side and her culture and also take care of those come from my father’s side. All those things make up the identity that I am today.
                        <br> <b>Me:</b>	We always focus on what we do not know rather than what we do know. What I feel is that the nature is the gift and nurture is what you do with the gift. (handshakes)
    
                    </i><br><br>In conclusion, the truth of the matter is that it does not matter which part of our identity we draw from as long as we develop an identity to draw from. In the past, it was okay, to feel inadequate, you feel like you do not fit it and that without knowing any of your identity, you will not know any of the identity.  We have to know ourselves because, the pieces we do have are always enough for now and there is resilience for that. Look at the Africans example Toni Morrison, Zora Neale Hurtston, Wilma Rudolph so much of our culture and connections to our ancestry home was taken away from us and because of that, you can argue the inert nature of the black.

                       <h2>Importance of African culture, gender awareness demonstrating its importance in accounting.</h2>
                       <p>
                        Agikuyu culture plays a major role in accounting in various ways;
                        They offer a sense of belonging. When an accountant knows where he is coming from, he works to protect his own people from harm.
                        They offer character/ behaviour – agikuyu culture is the first culture that trains the accountant from his tentative age, it instils morals, accountability of the accountant .
                        It offers security and unity – an accountant understands his language more and is able to understand and converse freely in his language without the others understanding what he is saying.
                        Religious values<br>
                        African traditional religion also has the belief that good and bad spirits do exist and that these spirits are what make communication with the Supreme Being possible. The worship of different deities on different days goes on to show that the African people hold their religious values in high esteem. Sorcerers and diviners are seen to be mediating between God and man and interpreting God's wishes to the mortal. 
                        Accountant holds a belief in the existence of the human soul and the soul does not die with the body, therefore there is a Supreme God that they believe in.
